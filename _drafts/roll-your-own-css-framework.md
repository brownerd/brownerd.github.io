Here's how you roll your own CSS Framework.

1. Get pissed that all these other frameworks and Sass helps are a pain to work around.
2. Complain online and to your friends that everything sucks
3. Actually rolling your own CSS Framework the next day.

Honestly, rolling your own Framework is pretty easy. Here's how it goes:

1. Design
  columns
2. Annotate your comps
  look before you leap
3. Set up your projects structure
  4. Base/Config/defaults CSS
  - reset
*
or
normalize (forms mostly)
- typography
only typeography!
- buttons
- forms
- layout
  your grid

5. Modules
6. Refine as you go
7. Done
