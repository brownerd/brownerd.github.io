Worth


Do you know your worth? What is your salary requirement?

It’s hard to figure out, right? You’re not alone in this confusion. Believe it or not, your worth is not a “fixed” thing. Various places pay more or less the the next place. Some places let you negotiate your starting salary, others don’t. Some places tell you that everyone starts at the same rate, and then you get raises based on your performance. Or you look at your peers and try to figure out where you fit in based on how much they make (if they tell you). Then you think about how many years you’ve been working, or what your skill level is across several different programming languages and tools.

UGH! It can be super hard to figure this out! But here’s where it get’s uncomfortably easy… You are worth whatever you want.

Let that settle in for a moment.

You can ask for whatever you want. You can even change your mind whenever you want.

But since they don’t teach this stuff in nerd school, this is how you figure out your salary requirements:

1. Just pick a number that you’d like to make. I don’t care what it is. Just pick a number that feels good, honest and appropriate to you.

You arrive at this number by figuring out how much your annual life costs. Seriously, what are your bills each month. How much does gas and food cost each month. How much would you like to save each month? How much do you want to spend on vacations each year? How much spending money do you want each month? How fast do you want to pay down your debts?

You can simply pick a number or do the math to figure out what you need.


2. Now find a place that is willing to pay that. Get hired and BOOM, you’re making what you’re worth. Everyone is happy.

If you are going to be real about your number, then you have to be real about the place that you are looking to make that. If you want 100k then you can’t ask a non-for-profit start up for that. Similarly, if you are applying for a job that pays 40k, you’d be an ass to ask for 100k instead.


Some places ask you what your salary requirements are off the jump. Be prepared to respond. What ever you want, put 10-15k on top of that. There is a good chance that your employer will automatically negotiate down. For example, if your number is 75k then ask for 85k. If you get it, cool! But there is a good chance that your future boos will say, how about 75k. And there you are.

My point is this, there are people that know less than me that are getting paid more than me. And there are people that know more than me that are making less than me.



It is a trade








YOU NEVER NEED TO DO FREE WORK TO THEN BE QUALIFIED TO DO PAID WORK!!!




If you want to be undervalued, take an internship and then hope that you get hired at the amount that you’d with to make.

Yeah but how do you do that?




Change mind, want more.



Know your shit.




Your salary requirement should be whatever you “want” to make. I say “want” because we don’t always get what we “want.” But YOU choose what ever you “want” your worth to be.

For example, here are a few worth scenarios:

1. I want to make 100k just because that’s what I want.


The only thing standing between you and getting paid 1 million a year is figuring out how to make it.





The secret to figuring out your worth.






Can you make the client happy?
Can you manage the code base?
Did you make a profit after completing the project?

Then you are kicking ass!
