As typographers, we are an opinionated bunch. While others read/digest text with enjoyment, we freak out about kerning, ligatures, measure, vertical rhythm, font selection, etc. Some of us type nerd are just sensitive to the way things look, others among us are dedicated to sticking to the age old rules of the trade. Despite the shit storm of opinions this article might generate, I think that it's worth having a discussion about which age old principles of typography actually even apply to the web. The vast history of typography rests in print or hand writing on fixed paper dimensions. Limitless vertical real-estate and screen resolutions are free from the limitations of paper. I think that we nee to argue about how to handle these new freedoms, and recognize that WE have the chance to figure out what works best for the web.  Here are my opinions below. I'd love to hear yours.



## Measure (Characters per line - CPL)

Measure describes how the average count of characters in a line of text. Traditional measure states that 60-80 characters per line is a desired measure.

I think that a webpage can be far more that this. I don't agree that 80 characters/line is easier to read than 160. Yes, I think that the CPL in a Wikipedia line is too long, but I can still read it fine. I know, it looks and feels uglyâ€”but I can read it.

Our text needs to be able to adapt to different screen dimensions. This need is not covered by traditional typography. Our webtype does not need to fit in a book or magazine with matching pages. There isn't a crease in the middle either. Longer character counts aren't harder to read online.

I'm not arguing for a new standard measure. I'm arguing that the current 60-80 CPL is no longer worthy online. And let's be honest, CPL is way over 80 throughout the web already, and no one but us typenerds fucking care.

80+ it is, but Wikipedia CPL no.



## Rags, Widows and Orphans
Rags are the jagged side of text. If your text is left aligned, then it is also rag right. Widows happen when only a word or two is on the last line of a paragragh. Orphans are similar, but these happen when only a line or two of text from a paragraph gets split between two columns or the end of a page.

Adjusting rags and widows in a webpage seems crazy to me. You can do this as long as the width of the column stay the same, but we don't have this luxury in a website due to responsive design needs.

Orphans on the other hand should never happen. Vertical real-estate is never ending. I do see this happening in sites that break up their stories over multiple pages for the purpose of improving their click through rates and pay-per-view ad. I fucking hate when this happens.


I am not wrestling with rags and widows.



## Leading
Leading is the vertical spacing bewteen lines of text in a paragraph. You are supposed to increase the leading in longer measures, and decrease it in shorter measures.

Online, line-height is used for leading. Most times line-height gets set to 1.5. However,  people set their line-height to what they think looks best.

I say, just do what you want.


##  Vertical rhythm
Vertical rhythm is like a sheet of lined paper. The lines tell you where to write. This keeps your writing even spaced from line to line. It also helps you line up your text between facing pages.

Vertical rhythm is a beast to manage online. Even though things look nice and evenly spaced online, they almost always deviate from a strict vertical rhythm.

And does it even matter online. Websites don't have facing pages.

I love this topic so here my long write up on that.




## Column grids
A column grid keeps your content 


## font selection



## kerning

Kerning is the art of spacing letters in relation to each other to achieve sexy looking words.

Fuck kerning online. I'd argue that this is what you should be doing in Illustrator before you put your logotype online. I'm fine leaving this up the the web font foundries to determine. I don't want to use JS or wrap each letter in a span to space letters in a logotype. YES, I've done it before online. I'd rather do it offline and use and SVG instead.



## ligatures



## Others

It's important to point out that while we are pitching a fit about typography, we are in the minority. Most don't give a shit. The majority of people digest typography like fast food. They get it because it's quick and it's what they want. If the line is long, they will wait.

I think that the urge to get what you want is greater than the impatience
