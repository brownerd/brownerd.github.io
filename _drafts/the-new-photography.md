title: The new photography
---
We live in a new world of photography. The "casual" photo, is the new professional photo. Gone are the years of going to a studio, or having a professional photographer bring his/her studio crap to your school/office. We digest so many photos via Facebook, Instagran and email, that the candid photo has become the new standard. Seriously, whenever we see one of those "studio" shots with that shitty DMV backdrop in it, we think the image is generic and cheesy.

Of course, the younger people get this. In fact it's not even a topic of discussion. They take awesome candid photos with their phones and happily use them for whatever profile pic they need.

However, "us" older people, that grew up in the "crappy backdrop era," we painfully believe that we need that same lame setup to use professionally online. This results in the most drab, boring and generic images that only make us look older and forgettable.

So quit that shit!
