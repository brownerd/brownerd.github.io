I have 365 days to learn JS. This seems like a long time, but I feel like I'm sprinting a marathon.

I made a pen on CodePen called [
Hellacolor, Flexbox, animation and music](http://codepen.io/brownerd/pen/doxPWQ) on August 23, 2015. It was the first time that this programming shit started to make sense. Up to this point, I never really had anything that needed programming over the past 8 years.

I was/am a designer. Before that, a Photographer. And before that, a Social Worker. Where the fuck if this going. Point is, I've done a shit ton of design, html, css, wordpress, and jquery plugin installation. But only 3 times in 8 years have I ever had to make a little app with JS.

I was always surprised that I was able to google my way through it, but I also knew that I had no fucking clue what I was doing. Yes, we can all hack it 'til we crack it. But, now, I want to know how to write JS.

So, I’m going to start keeping a journal of my JS learning. I’m doing this because I’m trying to teach myself and it feels like a massive undertaking. I got laid off on Oct 19, 2015, and I've been hitting the JS gym hard ever since. It's Dec 9th and it's time to start recording all of this. Between Oct 19 and Dec 9 I have:

- Started looking over the JS docs on Mozilla to learn the methods
- Watched nearly all of Kyle Young's videos on YouTube
- Started the Coderbyte challenges
- Made a tool called Budojo to learn JS
- Started to learn about functional programming from Jafar on EggHead.io
- Did a HTML5 canvas series from TutsPlus
- Been trying to learn React. There are so many differing approaches and outdated tuts. This has been super hard to make sense of.
- Learned the basics of Webpack
- Made a tool called Wudojo to learn JS
- Started to use ESLINT
- Found FunFunFunction and watched all the video
- Started Read/Watched all of Eric Elliott's posts on Medium
- Looked into Node a little bit



## DAY 1 - Dec 9 - Testing

On deck:

- Grep testing with TAPE via Eric Elliott's post on Medium

This testing stuff has made zero sense to me until today. Following Eric Elliot has helped a ton in many ways with learning more about JS best practices. His advice about simply using TAPE has made this TDD concept startable. I'll pass on all that Mocha, Chai, Jasmine stuff right now.

After reviewing all of these Read/Watched below, I was able to get a couple tests working.


Read/Watched:

- [Testing Client/Server JavaScript](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLqCXLYCqTI)
- [Zuul](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zuul) Browser testing
- [TDD in ES6 & React Webcast](https://ericelliottjs.com/product/tdd-es6-react/)
- [TDD in ES6 and React Examples](https://github.com/ericelliott/tdd-es6-react)
- [Tape testing guide](https://ci.testling.com/guide/tape)
- [5 Questions Every Unit Test Must Answer](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/what-every-unit-test-needs-f6cd34d9836d#.doifwlifl)
- [Why I use Tape Instead of Mocha & So Should You](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/why-i-use-tape-instead-of-mocha-so-should-you-6aa105d8eaf4#.wuhl3mnp7)

I need to get out of this info absorption period and into the coding period.

I have a bunch of Read/Watched that I want to watch/read before I start making shit. I'm trying to get a bunch of basics and base skills in order first.


Notes:

- Even though I said that I'm just starting out, and that I suck at JS, I am still listing some higher lever stuff above. How did I learn about strings, arrays, objects, functions, variables, conditionals and the other super basic stuff that takes a while to grasp? I learned all of this from CSS. I learned all of these programming basics from using Stylus and Jade on Codepen and a few client projects. I might even recommend learning these fundamentals first through Preprocessors because you can see the visual effects of the programming.

- I need to start thinking of little apps that I can make at every level of JS skill. My problem is that I don't know what to make. Yes, I want to build an awesome App with React, but I'm far from that at the moment.

- The TDD cycle goes like this: Test > Fail > Pass > Refactor.
- No more than 40 SLOC per file (source lines of code)

- Wrestled with getting a different TAPE test to run from another author. It was a Babel error. I had to add a Babelrc file. I did, but I save it in the wrong place by accident.

- Ok. Got Tape working for Unit Testing. I got Isparta working for CodeCoverage.

      - Computer programs are the most complicated thngs people make
      - we should prefer forms that are error resistant
      - 'goto' was reinvented as the 'switch' statement
      - we spend most of our time correcting our mistakes, NOT writing code
      - Medieval copiest introduced lowercase, word breaks and punctuation (these innovations helped reduce the error rate)
      - use `x += 1` instead of `x++` or `++x`

- [Managing Programmers by Douglas Crockford at Silicon Valley Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NPlMcUxFOlY)
    - Developers are creatives
    - Programming is not manufacturing, thus using development metrics don't apply
    - Negotiation is the only thing that determines salary! Haha! True
    - we need to perfect the process of trial and error
        - I argue that "perfect" is a system that reveals issues/bugs quickly AND has a process to fix them and inform others
            - NOTHING fails silently! Booby Trap jobs

    - Give Programmers "Directed Anarchy" Give them very clear requirements, and give them the authority, annatomy to figure out the best way to accomplish it--and get out of their way
    - You can only know which programmers are good by reading their source code
    - **Dailies** - Every day we do a code reading. (I love this idea)
        - do we understand all of it
        - if we do this every day, we will have a better idea of who knows what they're doing and who doesn't
        - Goals - to make your code highly readable
    - Hiring - bring them in and read code together
      - a good hire will be able to discuss and read code
      - if they cant communicate their code, then they're probably not a good fit
      - Bring in a portfolio of code
    - The 5 natural enemies of programers
        - Complexity. Humans are not good at managing complexity. Knowledge and experience is the only thing that enables us to manage complexity
            - You want to have continuing education. quality of work goes up
        - Imperfection. Computer programs should be perfect. Software can change instantly from asset to liability (without even changing the code base). Don't pit the QA against the programmers. We need to test, but that isn't the end of it. Use software etomology. find a bug, and study it to understand it
        - Time. time gets wasted doing Premature optimization, debugging, decision making paralysis. scheduling is tough, "we don't know know long it's going to take to sail to the new world." Most of what we are doing is "innovative", thus we are dealing with the unknown. Prorgammers don't get enough sleep.
        - Mismanagement. Rushing employees, distracting them, adding new poeple in the middle, NOt starting over when it's needed. You need to protect your programmers. Tell them, "if it's stupid, we wont do it." we won't ship crap. Business reality.
        - Themselves. Informed ignorance. cults and fads. teach them to be better people. remind them that we are creating for the PEOPLE, not just us. Programmers are creatives, not OFFICE PEOPLE. Find FLOW. No cubilces and Open plans. Let programmers use their own machines

    - Performance reviews are a waste of time. Shouldn't wait a quarter to assess how it's going. this should be happening daily instead.
    - Rotate everyone through customer service. Everyone needs empathy for how our users interact with out crap.

- [History of Programming Languages](http://cdn.oreillystatic.com/news/graphics/prog_lang_poster.pdf)
    - Terse. a tweet
    - OO makes code understandable by encapsulating moving parts.
FP makes code understandable by minimizing moving parts. - Michael Feathers
    - can use recursion to avoid having an iterator variable
    - the value at that point of time is it's state

    - Variables have no type. But the Value does have a type
    - Static languages like C take a type on the variable
    - I couldn't get the challenge to work. Yes some stuff worked, but i gave up after a while and just watched the video. I made it a bit more complicated than it needed to be compared to the solution.
    - closure is when you intentionaly want for a function to remember stuff outside so it can remember it's state

    - Teaching is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your understanding is - Ashley Williams
- [Simple Made Easy](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy)
    - Simple - one fold or one twist. We get ease of understanding, debugging and extending.
    - Easy - close at hand. Easy is a relative term. It's easy if you already know it. It's hard if you don't.
    - What's true about every bug? it passed all the tests!
    - If you ignore complexity, you will slow down in the long run
    - We have to make things simple by making things easy
    - We look at new tool for benefits, but we rarely take into account the downsides.
    - State and Objects are complex, values are simple
    - Methods are complex and functions are simple, namespaces are simple
    - vars are complex
    - inheritance is complex, polymorphism is simple
    - syntax is complex
    - Data is simlpe
    - Actors are complex
    - ORM is complex
    - Conditionals are complex, rules can be simpler
    - Complect - is bad.  to intertwine or braid.
    - Compose - to place together
    - Having state in your program is never simple because is complects value and time.
    - vars and refs don't make state simple
    - inheritance is complect
    - vars complect values and time
    - functions are stateless methods
    - Simplicity often means that you will have more things, nicely alligned
    - But you wont have fewer things knotted together

- [Growing a Language, by Guy Steele](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0)
    - A small language with warts will beat a well designed language, because users will not wait for the right thing. they will use the language that is quick and cheap
    - a language should plan for growth (vocabulary and rules)
    - a library adds vocabulary
    - The Cathedral and the Bazaar
    - more users find more bugs
    - a design should make choices now, but leave room for choices later

### Feb in review

- Went hard on the tuts at Front End Masters
- Beloved cat, bumshiqua, died at the beginning of this month
- Learning that I need to focus more on becoming a good programmer than just learning a JS an some frameworks. Of course I want to know JS and some frameworks, but looking in to FP, Elm and Haskell is showing more about programming that I didn't know existed
- It's been great learning more about the History of programming from Eric Meijer's
- There is no way I could have passed an entry test into hack reactor a few months ago. I probably still couldn't do it today. There is no Zero to Hero path in 3 months when you don't have core programming experience. Also, I couldn't imagine getting into a hack reator like program just to learn what I've gain in the past 3 months. Yes I feel like I've learned a ton, but I still don't even know how to even write a simple App.
- There's just so much to see in js. Yes, i want to get better at writing this stuff. Yet watching these video helps to fill in sooo much context.
- It's painful seeing all this shit for the first time. I don't have enough experience with this stuff to make sense of it. So, I slog through a tut, watch a video, write the code and hope, that one day, it will all make sense.

- Started looking in to RxJS through FrontEndMasters. This is an amazing series. Jafar does an excellent job teaching Async JS and RxJS!
- Started looking in to FP more. Still confusing, but getting clearer. I feel like FP in JS is what Standard was to CSS and HTML. Wild Westing JS is going away. FP is the practice that is going to replace all the spaghetti code practices.

Left Over:
- Get simple recursion down
- Get forEach, map, filter, reduce, curry and other FP down in regards to Arrays and Objects
- Nested Loops need practice
- Get comfortable creating useful closures
- Start FrontEndMasters videos
- Object to Array / Array to Object
- Understand memory leaks in JS
- better understand "test interface, not its implementation"

Ideas:

- Web vs Print typography
    - Indentation vs new line (Both work, but one would require much more paper, thus more money)
    - Margins - it's where your thumbs and notes go. No smearing printed ink
    - CPL - Research proves that CPL doesn't aid Readability at. The CPL arguement needs to die. I think that CPL is more of an aesthetic argument than readability arguemnt. I think that different mediums (reading book, textbook, newspaper, photo book) had different CPLs. I'd argue that all printed mediums tried to fit the most text possible on a page to reduce material costs and to provide as standard as a reading experience as possible.

- Similar to BrainJS (i need a new name for this BTW) what if we could express dating/match making through code for nerds and make a UI for everyone else to understand


- Yeah, most websites look the same...so do cars. Also, back in the day, more was Photoshop centric. Design was 1st. Dev was second and management was third.

But now, we live in a world where EVERY FUCKING ASPECT of a webpage needs to be easy to modify. Dev can't be landlocked by design.


Great read. I'm old as shit, so let me say this...Photoshop used to rule in early web design. Unique design was what we did to stand out. BUT that shit wasn't manageable, performant, efficient or sustainable in the long run!  Real truth—design is NOT everything. Design is one part of the challenge of making something rad, scaleable, performant and manageable.

I don't think that the internet is killing (visual) creativity. It's just that we have so much fucking boilerplate these days. 10 years ago we had to design everything because there either was no boilerplate or existing boilerplate was absolute crap. I'd argue that there is a lot of good web design out there today but it's so prevalent that it feels lame.

Being old as shit, I can say that it felt like there was a lot more creative freedom 10 years ago. Shit, Flash ruled back then. Design was so out of control that we made you wait 30s to see all the hot Flash bullshit that we made. And if it wasn't Flash it was a website that was handcuffed to Photoshop generated assets. Design ruled.

But then SEO got hot and killed Flash. SEO hunger accelerated the content creation and content management needs. Now fighting for ranking trumped fighting for design.

Then mobile happened and design time had to be split into desktop, tablet and mobile views.

Then BootStrap happened an

I'd argue that the technical requirements of the web make designing for it a moving target.
