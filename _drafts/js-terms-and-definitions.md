## I/O

- [I/O - input/output](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/I/I_O.html) Short for input/output (pronounced "eye-oh"). The term I/O is used to describe any program, operation or device that transfers data to or from a computer and to or from a peripheral device. Every transfer is an output from one device and an input into another. Devices such as keyboards and mouses are input-only devices while devices such as printers are output-only. A writable CD-ROM is both an input and an output device.

## Object Literal

This is when you create an object with its literal syntax

```
const obj = {}
```

The old-school way to create an object is

```
const obj = new Object();

// obj = {}
```

Another way to create and object is to use Object.create()

```
const obj = Object.create(null);

// obj = {}
```
