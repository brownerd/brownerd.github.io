## Function Invocation or "calling" a function
A function is invocated using the parenthesis syntax `()`:

invokeMe()


## Higher Order Functions

A higher order function is a function that:

1. takes one or more functions as arguments
2. returns a function as a result
3. or both 1 and 2

## Object Literal

This is when you create an object with its literal syntax

```
const obj = {}
```

The old-school way to create an object is

```
const obj = new Object();

// obj = {}
```

Another way to create and object is to use Object.create()

```
const obj = Object.create(null);

// obj = {}
```
