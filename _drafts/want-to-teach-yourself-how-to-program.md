Real talkâ€”you CAN teach yourself how to program.

But, to do so, you will need to jump into the deepend so to speak. You will not drown, but you wont be able to swim either. You will be confused. You will get frustrated and you might even want to quit.

But if you stick with it, you WILL begin to get it. And by perservering you will find that you are better at swimming then you though.

I am currently learning JS and it has been a long fucking road. I was a confident designer and HTML/CSS guy, but bare-bones programming was hella confusing. I did tons of online tutorials and books before ANY of it started to make sense.

Then one day, it started to click.

My problem with learning was that most resources assume that you know a programming language already. And with a programming language, it's assumed that you know programming as well. I did not. Furthermore, all the crappy jQuery I wrote conditioned me to have the wrong mindset about JS and programming. So, I also had a ton of unlearning to do.

Anyway, I just dove in, I digested countless hours of JS resources and I felt like an absolute failure and idiot for months on end.

I constantly wondered when these frameworks would start to make sense. I wanted to know when I would be able to make a "cool" app.

I eventually bailed on learning frameworks and focused on basic, vanilla everything. And soon, everything started to begin to make sense.
