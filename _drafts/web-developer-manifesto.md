WEB DEVELOPER MANIFESTO

1. We wil not make stuff that is a pain in the fucking ass under tight deadlines
Time and Money are being burned with wreckless abandon when we have to Dev designs that are SUPERFLUOUS. It doesn't even matter how complicated they are. All SUPERFLUOUS designs are a fucking waste UNLESS there is ample time

1. We will not give conservative estimates
EVERY project, has stuff in it that we can not know at the time of estimation. There is also no way to account for every gotcha. We live in moving target land! Browsers change, Google Changes, SEO changes, Phones change, resolutions change, speeds change, servers change, languages change, plugins change.

1. We will not pull overnighters while everyone else gets to sleep. We will push the deadline back until we can finish

1. We will review designs for dev issues. We will then ask fellow devs if they know a quick solution. If none know, we will kill that design element

1. If we have to dev something that we have never made, we will ask other Devs about it before taking it on. (Functionality and Design)

1. We will not require everyone to work in the same manner as us.

1. We will conduct show and tells. This way we all learn how each other works.
