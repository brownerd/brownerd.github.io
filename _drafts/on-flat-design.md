## what
Flat design was bound to happen. Ski-U-morph whatever was destined to be challenged. This isn't an article about which is better. Honestly, I like them both. I think flat design evolved out of a need to spend more time on development then design. Google's Material Design is a slight step up from 100% flatness.

So, here is the history lesson...

I remember when Print was king. I remember when top dollar was spent on having the cool colorful shit. I remember when art directors ruled the web decisions. And everyone care about how it look, but no one asked how users would expreience it, and they didn't give a shit what the developer said.

Photoshop was king. Photoshop was even used to make websites, and that was ok! I'm making the point that more time was spent focused on the design/photoshop process then the development process.

But then a natural thing happened. Would you rather edit a site with code, or would you rather jump into photoshop to change and image and then load that into the site. Now, think about a site that must be edited throughout the day, and having to make a round trip to photoshop/illustrator to change design elements. I remember this shit. I conciously stopped making elaborate photoshop designs because it killed the speed at which I could manage the websites that I made. It's fast, efficient, and flexible to do everything in code.


During this time period, photoshopy designs gave way to code based designs. And then the practical became popular. This is not a new trend. For example, scrolling was deemed BAD at one point, and now this IS THE ONLY thing that clients latch on to as a sign of "good" design. But that came from the Flash years, when Flash sites couldn't scroll AND had to fit inside a 800x600px monitor. This short coming of Flash was handled by saying that "scrolling was bad."
And like that, non-scrolling Flash sites were in.

On another note, a developer can make a good looking site these day on their own. Bootstrap amd Material design are the helvetica of the dev world. Yes it's over used and you can spot it everywhere, but it looks good (enough) without the help (or cost) of a designer.

This so called flat era was bound to happen, and it's going to stay this way until highly rendered design becomes easier/faster to accomplish.

Top dollar is going into the code side now.



 This happens all the time. For example, designing for a financial institution is an exercise in shitty typography. They love micro font bullshit because they think it looks more professional. Well fonts got smaller to save on paper and print costs. So if you ever have to make a website in this space, they always want you to make the fonts smaller. Fucking idiots. Don't even get me started on lawyers (another horrible field for typography and identity). Good luck getting them to name their business after anything else than their names.

But I guess that my point

Today, that's different. Front and back end web development take a long time.
