We are young and shitty business people. We sabotage our business and the entire business relationship.

If you haven't run your own business before, then chances are—you totally suck at business. The one thing all business have in common is that they must make money to survive. Most of you will make money through a fairish trade. You will hope to get a job, and then you will most likely accept whatever offer it is that they give you. 





If I ask you for a dollar, would you give me a grand instead?
If I only have a minute to talk, will you try to hold me for an hour?
If I need a self-portrait, would you just make a portrait of yourself instead?

These are three crazy scenerios, but I see designers and developers doing this in their career every fucking day. Let me reframe these.

If I as for a $1000 website, will you deliver $1000 worth of work, or will you put in more effort than $1000 worth?

If I say I need a logo made in 3 days, will you ask me to wait for 30?

If I think some features would be cool, are you going to tell me that I'm dumb and only create the features that you want instead?


This shit happens ALL the time. My point is this—designers and developers are horrible at business because they make the whole fucking thing about THEMSELVES! Here's the problem with that.

If your rate is $50/hr, then that means that you have 20 hrs (2.5 days) to finish this website. If you can't get it done in that timeframe then you are loosing money.  And when you are loosing money, you get desparate and you make even crappier decisions. Like agreeing to make 4 websites for $1000 in month.


How much output is the "right" amount?

I don't want to get stuck in a touchy feelly discussion about what "good" design/development is. You better deliver the correct amount of awesome to a client or else you are nuking your bank account. Just because you get $100K to do a project doesn't mean that you will make any money off of it! And the bigger the project, the more likely it is that you will infact go over budget.

You're goal at every step is to get paid and to finis the work as quickly and as professionally as possible. I have to make a site for $1000, I am not going to write any fucking code, nor am I going to do any fucking design work either. I will suggest SquareSpace or WordPress. I will use a theme and leave it at that. I will not do anything custom. None of that. If the client drags their ass on getting content to me. I will put the project on pause to do something else. The client will have deadlines, and if they miss them, then I've got other shit to do as well.

If you think I'm being a hard ass, consider this. If you order a pizza, and they say it will be there in 20min, but it take 2 hrs, do you still leave a good tip?



Since we designers/developers are young, we are far more self-conscious than we really know. And since we have been living with mommy and daddy for so long, we are still used to thinking that it's all about what we want. And since we are so caught up in how we look, we ignore what the client really want. Because we are young and shitty business people we sabotage the entire business and business relationship.








Here are some things that never pay and should be avoided at all costs:

1. Business card design. People always think that since it's so small that it should just cost $50-200. Don't make anything gor this amount unless the client is paying $50-200 just to meet with you. If you are crazy/desparate enough to take this on you will end up doing dozens of redesigns, spacing chagnes, font changes and all the other things the client asks of you. And because you are a kind hearted creative/dev, you wont tell them no.

1. Logos. Same reasoning as above.

1. Websites

1. Any work for a friend or family member. It's true that friends and family are the low hanging fruit for young freelancers. But here's what happens. You offer them a deal, cuz you know them, and then they expect the world from you because they know you. That $100 project is no killing your time and your bank account. Also, they will most likely not even appreciate your work, because they don't view you as a professional. They simply see you as a buddy or a family member. If they do give you a referral, it will most like be to some one that they promised a deal to because they know you.




But you can do all of this stuff if you love it and it's worth more than the money to you. I totally get that. But if you want to do better business, you need to get better at business. Only do the things that make money, and increases your reputation.
