# It's time to move past WordPress

Why, because this is fucking crazy!




# What I want



## UX
- I want a client to be able to manage/model content in their way
- I want a client to be able to easily upload an image
- I want a client to be able to easily make a form
- I want a client to be able to easily 


## DX
- I don't want to type a <> tag or a p { } ever again.
- I want to dev code that gets built into production code
- I want a server that I can manage easily
- I want to model/organize CONTENT not just pages/posts
- I want to be able to use Git easily
- I want to set up CI easily
- I want other devs to be able to get up on the project quickly















If you want to make a "pure" blog site, then stick with WP. If you want anything else, then it's time that we figure out a better solution. Unfortunately, it is haled as THE PERFECT solution.

I beef is not with WP. WP is an awesome piece of software. My issue is that current client needs and dev pracitces have far surpased what WP has to offer. Let me take time to explain this:

## Unnatural
The nature of WP is a 'blogging' platform. WP kicks ass at this out of box. However, WP is commonly extended to make a plain-old-website / brochure-ware / vanity site...whatever you want to call it. Thus, it is bent outside of its nature to fit a purpose outside of its strong suit. As a result, it has to be developed under a page vs post context and a client must use a blogging CMS for everything BUT blogging.

I do agree that WP was the best option 8 years ago when there were no better solutions, but it's time for us to make something that better for devs and clients.


## Not easy

Though this flies in the face of the excepted truth that WP is "easy" for clients to manage, I'd argue that WP is no easier for a client today to manage today then it was 10 years ago. In fact, I'd argue that it is harder now for a client to use. A modern WP site is a Frankenstein of API, plugins, span comments, 404 errors,


## Malicious Hacker's paradise

WP sites get hacked to shit. I'm done fixing hacked WP sites. I won't support or dev a site that isn't moved to WPEngine anymore.


## Slow as shit

Unless you're managing cache constantly, your WP site is going to be slow to load. And if you are managing caching on a WP site, that means that you aren't making sites since WP performance is a pain.


## Image explosion

Once you upload an image, that turns in to several or worse yet dozens of other images.


## Dev Experience

Ugh.


## Client Experience





While the WP codebase has become better, the business of making WP site has turned to shit.

So, how is it that WP's codebase is maturing beautifully, yet selling WP dev is getting worse?





I’ve had a long love, then hate relationship with WP. For the record, WP is awesome. This is not an argument for trashing WP, but a call to


It is a phenomenal open-source project that has made me a lot of money in a short period of time. Yet, it has also been a nightmare that has taken my money and burned through my time. 

Overall, I don’t think that there is a “perfect” CMS out right now. Let’s be honest, WP is a “blogging” CMS that then gets repurposed into anything, but a blogging platform. 

It has solidified itself as the default, platform for brochure-ware sites. Squarespace has made it



WordPress evolved when making a site on your own was hard, and 'blogging' was the next new thing. Blogging was so new that people didn't even understand that a blog was a website. Most thought that




Making a site used to be hard. Few new how to code, most hoped that there was a way to simple click around and make/manage a website. WordPress, MovableType, and a few others provided an solution for these challenges. During this era, the "blog"
