My initial reaction to the new instagram logo was disgust. Then I reacted to why I was being such a hater.

## I hate it
Let's talk about the hate first. I thought the original Instagram logo was unique. Now it looks boring and generic. It's the last logo to the party to wear all the sutff that isn't cool anymore. If these were the early 2000's the Instagram logo would have a swoosh through it.

I think it's lame and painfully over-thought. There, I said it out loud.


## I'm just being a hater
That said, why am I being such a hater. It's not like Instagram owes me anything. They are free to do whatever they want with their logo. I still have the app on my phone. What is it about me that makes me feel like I have to call it crap? I don't know. Instagram will do fine despite any level of logo loathing.

## I'm a classic designer
Spending the last few years as a developer has shown me some of the lame things I used to do as a designer.
1. I used to tell clients that their logo sucked and it needed to be less crappy.
2. I used to think that making things look better/cooler would help their identity
3. I made it all about me, not about them and certainly not about their audience. I was acting as if I was their key to success through design alone. I've designed stuff for friends all the way up to mega brands like Anheiser-Bush, and I can't say that my high almight design ego has helped anyone's business make even a dollar more in revenue.
