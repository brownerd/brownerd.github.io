title: Popular Misconceptions
subtitle: How bad ideas become popular practices online

Designing and writing code is fun. It can also a pain in the ass. Especially when what's popular today, ends up being worthless tomorrow. Let's start this discussion with Flash...

### Fuckin' Flash
Flash took a crap on almost every aspect of the internet. When I started making websites in 2007, Flash was all the rage. We were so amazed by it that nearly everyone paid top dollar to animate the shit outta their website. The "Flashification" of all things web preached these popular misconceptions about the web:

1. Scrolling was bad
 Back then, a flash site existed inside an "unscrollable" box. We covered up this shortcoming of Flash by perpetuating the idea that "scrolling" was not all of a sudden a "bad" thing. And this one lie has become a popular misconception that still plagues us today. This is still the one design point that clients continue to believe.

2. Small text is better
 Again, since a Flash site existed inside a fixed box, this box still had to fit inside an 800x600 pixel resolution screen. Thus, a Flash site was even shorter and narrower that a non-flash site. With even less real estate, we used pixel witdh fonts set around 8px or so. Yes, it was hard to read, but we proclamed that it was "cooler." Fortunately, this practices is mostly dead online.

 As a side note, this is still alive and well in print. Many people think that "small" font sizes are a sign or coolness and professionalism on business cards or white-papers. Small font sizes traditionally exist for the purpose of cramming more information onto a piece of paper without having to PAY FOR MORE PAPER. When I sit in design meetings, nobody talks about how much they can save in paper costs by using a smaller font, they only request a smaller font that makes them look more professional. And no one ever mentions using a larger font to improve readability. Rant over.

3. Animation makes a website cooler
 With Flash's ability to animate anything, everything became animated. We all went overboard with animations in a Flash site. As a result, we had to make Loading screens just to load up all of the animations needed in the site. This was a time when UX reigned supreme over content. Just to see the content, a user would have to sit through a lengthy sequence of animated BS.

 As a result animations got a bad rap, and they were all but killed except for carousels and light-boxes. It's interesting how animation is now considered great UX again.

4. Carousels for everyone
 Flash made carousels easy to make and maintain. Every site came standard with a banner/header area with images that faded in and out or scrolled left to right. The carousel was automated and controlled by a simple next/previous UI. Despite the fact that no one ever visits a site to sit and watch through every image in a carousel to cycle through, this has been a hard piece of UI to break free from in a website design. This is the one piece of UI that nearly every client requests. I would like to name it CX in the place of UX. Carousels are not for usersâ€”they don't use them! Carousels are for the client experience. Carousels make clients feel good about their sites. This is not a dig on clients. I'm just pointing out popular misconceptions about what makes a website good.

5. Apple Killed Flash with the advent of the iPhone.
 This is such a popular misconception. Apple did not kill Flash. Flash killed itself. Once the world's business switched thier sites to Flash to be "cooler," they witnessed their Google rankings drop. Why, because Google could not read the content inside a Flash site. In the horror of lost rankings, the major business of the world stripped Flash from their websites. And like that, being a Flash developer became worthless. SEO (Google) killed Flash sites.
