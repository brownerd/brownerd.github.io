I think this is an initiation phase for all designers. To those designers that feel insecure, I say, WELCOME! You’ve made it! If you feel insecure, it’s because you care. And I want to work with people that care enough about their craft to question even themselves. But here’s the rub…it’s not about us. It’s about our clients. The goal is to make them happy. And if you can make your clients happy, then you will find your inner-security much faster. It’s not about you. It’s about them. If you want it to be about you, then go be an artist. Design aint got time for that.
