# Learning JS on your own with no prior experience
You are fucked!!!

Can you do it, of course you can. But there is NO defined path to take you from zero to hero.

What stands in your way from becoming proficient in JS is a long list of challenges:

1. Descerning between scores of crappy/dated resources
1. You have to read a shit load just to extract the few important nuggets
1. Creating a local JS dev playground
1. Figuring out what you can make for practice at any skill level
1. Writing JS as much as you fucking can
1. Learning Test Driven Development
1. Learning Gulp and or Webpack configuration
1. Learning a couple frameworks while experimenting with building your own
1. Learning Git and GitHub
1. Learning ES6 will the majority of resources are in ES5
1. Learning Functional Programming, Prototypal OO
1. DOM API
1. NODE


It is a TALL fucking order to get up on all of this stuff, but you can do it. I did. Yes, it fucking sucked at times. I had to cram fundamental into my brain. I had to code like there was no tomorrow. I had to learn stuff just to through it all away because it was wrong, or had been recently replaced my something new. I had to accept a gross level of confusion as a baseline.

I had to SUCK at JS for a long time.

I don't think that I'm a 'natural' or a 'gifted' developer. I was a natural creative and designer. I still love and enjoy designing and making visual shit. HTML and CSS come naturally to designer types. In my case, programming did not.

I wasn't until after 8 years as a design to htlm/css person that programming started to make sense. In learning to use Stylus for preprocessing CSS and Jade for HTML templates, I started to understand variables, functions and conditionals. And like that, I decided to take my pewny knowledge of programming and scale it in learning JS.


## People to follow

- Eric Elliot - One of the biggest problems with JS is that a lot of the resources for it were crafted by Java and C devs that attempted to make sense of JS through their Java/C training. Thus, there is a lot of info writen by these people that actually leads to writing 'bad' JS. Eric has been through this ringer and does a great job of helping you write JS the was JS works naturally
