Quit hatin!

Yes, we deal with frustrating code, clients and management everyday. Yes, it's natural to hate on it. I've certainly been a hater. But I try not to hate anymore. Here's why:

1. This is a hard and crazy line of work that requires shoting moving targets will juggling at the same time. Seriously, think about it...

2. You think you're doing a great job, and then best practices change.

3. You want to do your best, but management changes and they don't care about the process.

4. You want to do your best, but your peers quit.

5. You know you suck at something, but your company requires that you do it anyway.

6. You want to do your best, but the client wants to bake in more stuff.

7. You want to do your best, but the company you work for doesn't give a shit.

8. You want to do your best, but the project have no time or budget for it.

9. You want to do your best, but no one else cares.

10. You want to do your best, but there isn't time or a budget for a re-write of the code base.

11. You want to do your best, and you know that the project is doomed from all sides.

I think that very few people try to write the worst code in the world. Yet, I do know that all of use get thrown under the bus while we try to do the best we can. So, as it's easy and relieving to hate on who ever wrote those codez before youâ€”just remember that a time will come when everyone hates your old code too. You won't be able to explain that you had to cobble it together under bugdet,  that it was handed down to you without guidance in a framework that you where new too, that you didn't know that best-practices were going to change, that your company downsized before you had a chance to refactor..etc.

Thus, I no longer hate on the person before me. I embrace my brothers and sisters in this exciting yet unstable realm of web dev. And I work within MY constraints to push the code base forward with AWESOME DOCUMENTATION.

I'd like to buy a beer for anyone that has been in this field long enough to know what it's like to have today's best practices turn into yesterday's crap code. To all of you, I salute you!
