title: Designer OCD and how to deal with it
---

Every designer has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). We agonize over pixels, placement, and proportions. We feel disgusted if things are out of order or nonsensical. We can't rest until all of our designs are APPROVED by us. We feel defeated/pissed when a client/boss/anyone trumps our excellent design knowledge.

Yesâ€”this is unhealthy.

This condition makes us great designers, but is also makes us fucking impossible to deal with. Let me explain...

I am also a developer. I absolutely fucking hate it when I get a design I didn't make and the designer hold me to their pixel perfection. THIS IS FUCKING NUTS!

Anyone that can't code thier own designs, does not get final say in how a comp gets turned into code. Here's why:

1. If it takes to long, then we're loosing money
1. If it doesn't translate well from a static comp to an interactive webpage, it's gone
1. If it full of icons and and shit that ties it to Photoshop forever, it's gone

But the biggest issue is the money. YOUR WEB DESIGN IS NOT SAVING THE WORLD! AND THIS WEB SITE IS NOT FOR YOU EITHER!


We make money in this web dev/design world by charging and amount to make a profit, and getting our work done as fast as we can to maximize our profits. Here's what challenges that:

1. Under charging
1. Under estimating time
1. Scope creep
1. Unknown issues that can only be found by doing the work
1. Ever different design to code challenges for each fucking site



Answer honestly:

Is your navigation making the client a $1 more this year

If no, then chill the fuck out when I change your comps when coding.
