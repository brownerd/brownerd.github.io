Just a radical thought about responsive design...

What if we only designed for Chrome.

I would make two layouts:

1. One for Chrome Desktop
2. One for mobile.

All people with old browsers (found by feature detection) would get the simple mobile experiene.

My arguement here is that, you should serve a user experience that fits the user's browser.

If the user cares about great performance and browser capabilities, then they are updating and keeping their browsers fresh.

If they don't care then I don't either.

I'm tired of all the x-browser tweaking. I want to reward the ones that care.

But if the user doesn't care, nor want to try, then fuck, neither do I.

Look, if a website isn't going to make me money, then I'm only optimizing for those that care about a great browser experience. I'm not gpint to waste my time and money on those that could care less.

Furthermore, when that non-power user learns that there is a better experience waiting for them, now they have a choice to choose a better experience or keep things as they are.

Apple, does this. If you are still running OSX 9.0 you can't use AirPlay. Shit, if you don't have one of the latest computers, you can't use AirPlay either.

Browsers are free. They can update automatically. Much as people are expected to learn how to read, I expect people to become browser literate as well.
