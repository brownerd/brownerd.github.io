We need to be able to tell when we are not in Rome when we are designing and developing websites.

It has been my experience that the internet is full of best practices and technologies for companies like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, NY Times, UBER, AirBNB, but there isn't much for the small businesses or non-web businesses out there.

As a result, I see a lot of people employ the best tech stacks and practices to small businesses that can't use it, afford it nor manage it.

My argument is that we need to stop treating our small business clients like they are the big time businesses that we read about online everyday.
