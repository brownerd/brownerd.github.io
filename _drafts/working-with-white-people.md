# Working with white people

Fucking white people man!

This is going to a slightly uncomfortable talk for the white people in the audience. The truth hurts--deal with it.

Here we go...you all are a fucking pain in the ass to work with. Here's the top 10 reasons why:

1. My ideas don't matter until some other white person in the company says excatly what I've been saying for fucking ever. You all do this ALL THE FUCKING TIME.

For example, hey guys, let's use CodeShip for setting up CI.

2. My code and techniques get more scrutiny than the other white people that I work with


3. I am rarely considered for a posiiton of leadership compared to the white people that I work with.


4. You all say some fucked up shit every now and then...and then never apolagize for it. Like, all lives matter!


5. You ignore the fact that I don't fit in to your white cultural stuff.


6. If you ask me about my hair, skin tone, or ethnicity I will fucking `rm -rf ~` all your shit.

7. You throw us into the line of fire, but you don't with your white employees

8. You come down me for stupid shit, but you consistently give passes to your white employees

9. You lay us off first

10. You only make room for white shit
