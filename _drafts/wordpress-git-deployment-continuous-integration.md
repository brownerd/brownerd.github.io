Let's do this:

WPEngine
Github/Bitbucket
Codeship
done!

If you make WP themes, then there is a good chance that you just use FTP because you can. Simple yet commando.

If you are also familiar with Git, the you are probably frustrated by finding a Git + deployment workflow that isn't a hacky pain in the ass.

If you are familiar with hosting WP sites, then you know that hacking, performance, and ease of management gets hard to scale over time. Soon you aren't doing anything fun because juggling all your WP sites is taking up all your time.

If you are a dev that has figured all this shit out, then speak up now!

If you are not one of those aformentioned devs, there is a fun and easy way to accomplish all of the above and still have time to have fun living.


1. Let's make hosting, management, security, performance, versioning, deployment and development easy and powerful by moving to WPEngine. Here's what you get out of the box:
    - Faster loading speeds. WPE aggressively manages the caching and provides a CDN that you can enable with one click.
    - Easy management. Manage all of your client's accounts from your account
    - Awesome security. WPE prevents problematic plugins, and they scan your site for hacks.
    - Backups. WPE backs up your site everyday, and retains 30 consecutive days of back ups.
    - Versioning. WPE allows you to make snapshots of your site on the fly.
    - Git. WPE allows you to Push your code
    - Staging. WPE allows you to create a Staging site in one click.
    - Deployment. WPE allows you to deploy using Git Push or SFTP.
    - Support. WPE offers live chat and a ticketing service. They respond right away.
    - SSL. WPE make setting up SSL just a couple clicks.
    - Transfers. Spin up a site for a client and easily transfer it to a client for billing.
    - Error logs. Chech error logs from WPE admin
    - Updates. WPE manages my WP core updates.

    I no longer wrestle with WP issues. WPE manages all of that for me.

2. Let's make the Git workflow and deployment easy too.
  - Get a free account with Codeship
  - Connect to your Github or BitBucket repo in one click
  - Get a Public Key for your project from Codeship
  - Paste in in WPE's GitPush panel
  - Depoly to Staging or production when you merge code in your repo. (configure how ever you want)

3. Fucking done! Go live.
